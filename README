Here's a comprehensive Node.js script that creates the 2log command-line tool you requested. The script will:

Create timestamped entries: Formats entries as - HH:mm Your message
Handle daily notes: Creates daily notes with YYYY-MM-DD.md format
Find the correct position: Locates the ## Today header and appends entries as the last item under it
Create missing files: If today's daily note doesn't exist, it creates one with a basic template

Setup Instructions:

Save the script: Save it as 2log.ts (or 2log.js if you prefer JavaScript)
Install dependencies (if using TypeScript):
```bash
npm install -g typescript @types/node
```
Compile (if TypeScript):
```bash
tsc 2log.ts
```
Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x 2log.js
```
Create a global command (optional but recommended):
```bash
# Create a symlink in your PATH
sudo ln -s /path/to/your/2log.js /usr/local/bin/2log
```

Usage Examples:
```bash
# Basic usage
2log "Had a productive morning call"

# Multi-word entries
2log "Meeting with Sarah went well - discussed project timeline"

# The script will create entries like:
# - 14:30 Had a productive morning call
# - 15:45 Meeting with Sarah went well - discussed project timeline
```
Key Features:

- Automatic file creation: Creates daily notes if they don't exist
- Smart positioning: Always adds entries as the last item under ## Today
- Error handling: Provides clear error messages if the journal directory doesn't exist
- Timestamp formatting: Uses 24-hour HH:mm format
- Markdown compatible: Generates proper markdown bullet points for Obsidian

The script will create daily notes in the format 2025-06-04.md in your specified journal directory. If the ## Today header doesn't exist in an existing file, it will throw an error to prevent corruption of your existing notes.
